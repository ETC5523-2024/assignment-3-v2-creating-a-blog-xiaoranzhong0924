    "text": "Data Description\nThe data used for this analysis was sourced from the TidyTuesday project (June 18, 2024). It includes two key datasets:\n\nfederal_holidays: A list of established federal holidays, along with their official names and the years they were established.\nproposed_federal_holidays: A collection of holidays that have been proposed but not yet adopted.\n\n\nData Variables:\n\nfederal_holidays: Contains variables such as official_name, date, year_established, and purpose.\nproposed_federal_holidays: Includes proposed_name, year_proposed, and supporter (indicating who advocated for the holiday).\n\n\n\nData Cleaning Steps:\n\nColumn names were standardized using the janitor::clean_names() function to ensure consistency.\nMissing values were removed, and the dataset was subsetted to include only holidays with clear establishment or proposal dates.\nDate columns were formatted to YYYY-MM-DD for ease of plotting and analysis.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nThis analysis first examines the timeline of established federal holidays. The figure below shows the years in which U.S. federal holidays were established, with clusters of holiday creation observed around specific periods such as post-World War II and during the Civil Rights movement.\nThe timeline of federal holiday creation reveals that many holidays were introduced during times of significant social or political change. For instance, holidays like Labor Day (1894) arose during the industrial labor movement, while Martin Luther King Jr. Day (1983) highlights the nation’s growing recognition of civil rights.\nRecent years have seen an increased push for holidays that emphasize inclusivity, such as Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans and was established in 2021. There are also current proposals, such as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, reflecting a shift in acknowledging the contributions of Native Americans.\nFigure Figure 1 below visualizes the timeline of when federal holidays were established in the U.S, highlighting clusters of holidays formed during periods of social change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of the Establishment of U.S. Federal Holidays. This timeline visualizes the clustering of federal holidays around key social movements and historical events, with a notable rise during the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother insight is derived from analyzing proposed federal holidays, showing growing attention toward recognizing diverse cultural and historical groups.\nFigure Figure 2 below illustrates the distribution of proposed federal holidays by month, revealing that certain months see a higher concentration of proposals, suggesting specific cultural or historical importance during these times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of Proposed Federal Holidays by Month\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Table 1 presents a summary of the proposed federal holidays, including the proposed name, the year proposed, and the supporter of the holiday.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Proposed Federal Holidays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Name\nDate\nDate Definition\nSupporter\n\n\n\n\nNA\n3rd monday\nSusan B. Anthony Day\nThe holiday was proposed by Carolyn Maloney in H.R. 655 on February 11, 2011, and was not enacted. It would have fallen on the same day as Washington's Birthday.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nHarriet Tubman Day\nThe holiday was proposed by Representative Brendan Boyle in H.R. 7013 in March 2022.\n\n\nNA\nlast monday\nCesar Chavez Day\nThe holiday was proposed by Representative Joe Baca in H.R. 76 and was further endorsed by President Barack Obama.\n\n\nNA\n3rd monday\nMalcolm X Day\nThe holiday was proposed in H.R. 323 in 1993 and 1994 by Congressman Charles Rangel.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nFlag Day\nProposed several times, and became a national observance when President Harry Truman signed it into law.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nSeptember 11 Day of Remembrance\nThe holiday was proposed by Representative Lee Zeldin in H.R. 5303 and Senator Marsha Blackburn in S. 2735 in September 2021.\n\n\nNA\n3rd monday\nNative Americans' Day\nThe holiday was petitioned for and introduced in Congress multiple times but was unsuccessful. The proclamation exists today as \"Native American Awareness Week.\"\n\n\nNA\nfloating tuesday\nElection Day / Democracy Day\nMultiple movements for this holiday to be official have occurred, with the last happening during discussions for the \"1993 Motor Voter Act\", mainly to boost voter turnout.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nRosa Parks Day\nProposed as part of HR 5111 on September 3, 2021."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis reveals significant periods in U.S. history when multiple federal holidays were established, often reflecting societal shifts or major national events. Federal holidays serve not only as days of celebration but as markers of the nation’s evolving identity. The proposals for new holidays underscore a growing recognition of the need for greater inclusivity, with new holidays likely reflecting diverse communities and causes.\nAn academic study by Smith (2022) supports these findings, arguing that federal holidays play a critical role in reinforcing national unity while adapting to contemporary values."
