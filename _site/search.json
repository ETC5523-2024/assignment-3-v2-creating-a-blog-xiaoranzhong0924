    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis reveals significant periods in U.S. history when multiple federal holidays were established, often reflecting societal shifts or major national events. Federal holidays serve not only as days of celebration but as markers of the nation’s evolving identity. The proposals for new holidays underscore a growing recognition of the need for greater inclusivity, with new holidays likely reflecting diverse communities and causes.\nAn academic study by Smith (2022) supports these findings, arguing that federal holidays play a critical role in reinforcing national unity while adapting to contemporary values."
