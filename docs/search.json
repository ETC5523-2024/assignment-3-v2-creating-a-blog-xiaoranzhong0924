    "section": "The Data Behind Federal Holidays",
    "text": "The Data Behind Federal Holidays\nTo understand these trends, we turned to the TidyTuesday project (June 18, 2024), which provided two fascinating datasets:\n\nEstablished Federal Holidays: This includes the official names and establishment years of recognized U.S. holidays.\nProposed Federal Holidays: A list of holidays proposed but not yet recognized at the federal level.\n\nKey variables in these datasets included:\n\nFor established holidays: official_name, year_established, and purpose.\nFor proposed holidays: proposed_name, year_proposed, and supporter.\n\n\nData Processing: How We Cleaned the Data\nTo make sense of this information, we used R and the tidyverse packages to clean the data. This included removing missing values, standardizing column names using janitor::clean_names(), and ensuring all date formats were consistent for easy analysis.\n\n\nA Walk Through History: Established Federal Holidays\nWhen we look at the timeline of federal holidays, a few key trends emerge. Many of these holidays were established during periods of significant social change. For instance, Labor Day was created during the height of the labor movement in 1894, while Martin Luther King Jr. Day was recognized in 1983 amidst growing attention to civil rights.\nThe timeline shows clear clusters of holiday creation around critical periods, such as post-World War II and during the civil rights era.\nVisualizing the Timeline of U.S. Federal Holidays Here’s a look at when each U.S. federal holiday was established:\nAs you can see in Figure Figure 1, holidays cluster around certain moments of societal change. More recently, the establishment of Juneteenth in 2021 reflects a national shift toward recognizing African American history and struggles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of the Establishment of U.S. Federal Holidays. This timeline visualizes the clustering of federal holidays around key social movements and historical events, with a notable rise during the 20th century."

    "text": "The Push for New Holidays: Proposals on the Table\nWhile the current roster of federal holidays stands as a reflection of our history, the future may hold even more. Proposed holidays like Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Environmental Action Day emphasize underrepresented groups and causes that have long been overlooked in national observances.\nBy analyzing the month when these proposals are typically introduced, we can uncover patterns in their timing.\nIn Figure Figure 2, we observe that certain months see a higher concentration of holiday proposals. This could indicate a pattern tied to specific cultural events or advocacy movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of Proposed Federal Holidays by Month\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Table 1 presents a summary of the proposed federal holidays, including the proposed name, the year proposed, and the supporter of the holiday.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Proposed Federal Holidays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Name\nDate\nDate Definition\nSupporter\n\n\n\n\nNA\n3rd monday\nSusan B. Anthony Day\nThe holiday was proposed by Carolyn Maloney in H.R. 655 on February 11, 2011, and was not enacted. It would have fallen on the same day as Washington's Birthday.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nHarriet Tubman Day\nThe holiday was proposed by Representative Brendan Boyle in H.R. 7013 in March 2022.\n\n\nNA\nlast monday\nCesar Chavez Day\nThe holiday was proposed by Representative Joe Baca in H.R. 76 and was further endorsed by President Barack Obama.\n\n\nNA\n3rd monday\nMalcolm X Day\nThe holiday was proposed in H.R. 323 in 1993 and 1994 by Congressman Charles Rangel.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nFlag Day\nProposed several times, and became a national observance when President Harry Truman signed it into law.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nSeptember 11 Day of Remembrance\nThe holiday was proposed by Representative Lee Zeldin in H.R. 5303 and Senator Marsha Blackburn in S. 2735 in September 2021.\n\n\nNA\n3rd monday\nNative Americans' Day\nThe holiday was petitioned for and introduced in Congress multiple times but was unsuccessful. The proclamation exists today as \"Native American Awareness Week.\"\n\n\nNA\nfloating tuesday\nElection Day / Democracy Day\nMultiple movements for this holiday to be official have occurred, with the last happening during discussions for the \"1993 Motor Voter Act\", mainly to boost voter turnout.\n\n\nNA\nfixed date\nRosa Parks Day\nProposed as part of HR 5111 on September 3, 2021."

    "text": "Conclusion: Federal Holidays, a Mirror of Society\nFederal holidays tell the story of the United States. They are markers of our nation’s progress and moments of reflection. As society continues to evolve, so too will the holidays we observe. The current push for more inclusive holidays like Indigenous Peoples’ Day demonstrates our ongoing desire to ensure that the stories of all Americans are recognized.\nLooking ahead, it’s likely that new holidays will emerge to reflect the nation’s shifting values, and they will serve as important reminders of the people, movements, and causes that shaped our history."
