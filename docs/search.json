Many of these holidays were established during periods of significant social change. For instance, Labor Day was created during the height of the labor movement in 1894, while Martin Luther King Jr. Day was recognized in 1983 amidst growing attention to civil rights.\nThe timeline shows clear clusters of holiday creation around critical periods, such as post-World War II and during the civil rights era.\nVisualizing the Timeline of U.S. Federal Holidays Here’s a look at when each U.S. federal holiday was established:\nAs you can see in Figure Figure 1, holidays cluster around certain moments of societal change. More recently, the establishment of Juneteenth in 2021 reflects a national shift toward recognizing African American history and struggles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of the Establishment of U.S. Federal Holidays. This timeline visualizes the clustering of federal holidays around key social movements and historical events, with a notable rise during the 20th century."

The ball drop at Times Square in New York City, broadcast live on television nationwide, has become a national New Year's festivity. Serves as the traditional end of the Christmas and holiday season.\n\n\nBirthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.\nJanuary 15\nJanuary 21\n3rd monday\nHonors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights leader who was born on January 15, 1929. Some municipalities hold parades, and since the 1994 King Holiday and Service Act, it has become a day of citizen action volunteer service, sometimes referred to as the MLK Day of Service. The holiday is observed on the third Monday of January, and is combined with other holidays in several states.\n\n\nWashington's Birthday\nFebruary 15\nFebruary 21\n3rd monday\nHonors George Washington, Founding Father, commander of the Continental Army, and the first U.S. president, who was born on February 22, 1732. In 1968, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act shifted the date of the commemoration from February 22 to the third Monday in February, meaning the observed holiday never falls on Washington's actual birthday. Because of this, combined with the fact that Abraham Lincoln's birthday falls on February 12, many now refer to this holiday as \"Presidents' Day\" and consider it a day honoring all American presidents. The official name has never been changed.\n\n\nMemorial Day\nMay 25\nMay 31\nlast monday\nHonors U.S. military personnel who have fought and died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. Many municipalities hold parades with marching bands and an overall military theme, and the day marks the unofficial beginning of the summer season. The holiday is observed on the last Monday in May.\n\n\nJuneteenth\nJune 19\nJune 19\nfixed date\nCommemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States on the anniversary of the 1865 date when emancipation was announced in Galveston, Texas. Celebratory traditions often include readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, singing traditional songs, rodeos, street fairs, family reunions, cookouts, park parties, historical reenactments, and Miss Juneteenth contests.\n\n\nIndependence Day\nJuly 4\nJuly 4\nfixed date\nCelebrates the 1776 adoption of the Declaration of Independence from British rule. Parades, picnics, and cookouts are held during the day and fireworks are set off at night. On the day before this holiday, the stock market trading session ends three hours early.\n\n\nLabor Day\nSeptember 1\nSeptember 7\n1st monday\nHonors and recognizes the American labor movement. Over half of Americans celebrate Labor Day as the unofficial end of summer. Roughly 40% of employers require some employees to work on the holiday. The holiday is observed on the first Monday in September.\n\n\nColumbus Day\nOctober 8\nOctober 14\n2nd monday\nHonors Christopher Columbus, whose exploration of the Americas from 1492 to 1504 marked the beginning of large scale European immigration to the Americas. In some areas it is instead a celebration of Native Americans (Indigenous Peoples' Day). In other areas it celebrates Italian culture and heritage. The holiday is observed on the second Monday in October, and is one of two federal holidays where stock market trading is permitted.\n\n\nVeterans Day\nNovember 11\nNovember 11\nfixed date\nHonors all veterans of the United States armed forces. It is observed on November 11 due to its origins as Armistice Day, recalling the end of World War I on that date in 1918. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at 11:00, of the 11th day, of the 11th month of 1918, when the Armistice with Germany went into effect. It became Veterans Day after World War II. It is one of two federal holidays where stock market trading is permitted.\n\n\nThanksgiving Day\nNovember 22\nNovember 28\n4th thursday\nTraditionally celebrates the giving of thanks for the autumn harvest, and commonly includes the sharing of a turkey dinner. Several large parades are broadcast on television, and football games are often held. The holiday is observed on the fourth Thursday in November. On the day after this holiday, the stock market trading session ends three hours early.\n\n\nChristmas Day\nDecember 25\nDecember 25\nfixed date\nThe most widely celebrated holiday of the Christian year, Christmas is observed as a commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Commonly celebrated by Christians and some non-Christians with various religious and secular traditions. On the day before this holiday, the stock market trading session ends three hours early.In some years where December 25 falls on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, various presidents have issued executive orders declaring a one-time holiday on either Christmas Eve (December 24) or the Day after Christmas (December 26), to provide federal workers with a longer weekend."

    "text": "Conclusion: Federal Holidays, a Mirror of Society\nFederal holidays tell the story of the United States. They are markers of our nation’s progress and moments of reflection. As society continues to evolve, so too will the holidays we observe. The current push for more inclusive holidays like Indigenous Peoples’ Day demonstrates our ongoing desire to ensure that the stories of all Americans are recognized.\nLooking ahead, it’s likely that new holidays will emerge to reflect the nation’s shifting values, and they will serve as important reminders of the people, movements, and causes that shaped our history."
